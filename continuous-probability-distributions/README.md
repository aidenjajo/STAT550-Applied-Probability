# Continuous Probability Distributions
*R Coding Assignment 5 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This assignment explores continuous probability distributions applied to healthcare, economics, consumer behavior, and quality control. Students demonstrate proficiency in working with Normal, Exponential, and Uniform distributions using R's built-in probability functions.

## Problem Scenarios

### 1. Birth Weight Analysis (Normal Distribution)
Analyzes newborn birth weights using normal distribution to identify proportions in various weight categories, calculate probabilities for weight ranges, and determine percentile thresholds for clinical significance.

### 2. Teacher Salary Analysis (Normal Distribution)
Models weekly teacher salaries to determine the probability of earnings above a specific threshold, demonstrating applications in labor economics and compensation analysis.

### 3. Airline Ticket Purchase Timing (Exponential Distribution)
Models the time travelers purchase tickets in advance using exponential distribution, relevant for airline revenue management and capacity planning.

### 4. Package Weight Quality Control (Uniform Distribution)
Analyzes manufacturing variation in package weights using uniform distribution, demonstrating quality control applications and the derivation of cumulative distribution functions.
