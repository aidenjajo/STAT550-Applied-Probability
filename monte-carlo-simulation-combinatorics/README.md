# Monte Carlo Simulation & Combinatorics Fundamentals
*R Coding Assignment 1 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This assignment introduces fundamental concepts in Monte Carlo simulation and statistical computing using R. It covers random sampling techniques and combinatorial mathematics essential for probability theory and statistical analysis.

## Topics Covered

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Random sampling using `sample()` function
- Binary outcome simulations (coin flips)
- Calculating means from simulated data
- Understanding expected values vs. observed results

### Combinatorics in R
- **Combinations** (`choose(n, k)`): Selecting k objects from n where order doesn't matter
- **Permutations** (`prod()`): Arranging objects where order matters
- **Factorials** (`factorial()`): Computing total arrangements of distinct objects
