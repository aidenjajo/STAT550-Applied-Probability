# Binomial Probability Distributions Analysis
*R Coding Assignment 3 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This assignment applies binomial probability distributions to solve real-world probability problems in healthcare, manufacturing, and risk assessment. Students use R's binomial distribution functions to calculate exact and cumulative probabilities.

## Problem Scenarios

### 1. Drug Side Effects Analysis
Analyzes the probability of dizziness as a side effect in a sample of 25 patients, modeling scenarios for exact counts, minimum thresholds, and maximum limits.

### 2. Green Bottles Probability
Calculates the likelihood of bottle-falling events with high probability of occurrence, demonstrating binomial applications in everyday scenarios.

### 3. Quality Control for Manufacturing
Evaluates defect rates in tire manufacturing to assess whether observed defects align with claimed quality standards.

## Topics Covered

### Binomial Distribution Theory
- Understanding fixed trials with binary outcomes
- Identifying when binomial distribution is appropriate
- Distinguishing between exact and cumulative probabilities

### R Programming for Probability
- `dbinom()` for exact probability calculations (P(X = x))
- `pbinom()` for cumulative probability (P(X ≤ x))
- Complement rule for "at least" probabilities (1 - P(X ≤ x))

### Statistical Interpretation
- Converting mathematical results to practical insights
- Assessing rare vs. common events
- Quality control decision-making based on probability
