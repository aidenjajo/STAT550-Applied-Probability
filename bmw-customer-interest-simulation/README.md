# BMW Customer Interest Simulation
*R Coding Assignment 2 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo simulation to a real-world business scenario. The simulation models customer viewing requests at a BMW dealership to estimate interest levels across different vehicle models.

## Scenario
BMW of Carlsbad wants to understand customer interest in their vehicle lineup. This simulation generates 1,000 random customer requests to estimate which models receive the most viewing interest, assuming equal probability for each model.

## Topics Covered

### Monte Carlo Simulation Application
- Simulating customer behavior using random sampling
- Generating large datasets through iterative sampling
- Creating frequency distributions from simulated data

### Data Analysis
- Building frequency tables with `table()` function
- Using loops for iterative data generation
- Formatting output with `kable()` for professional presentation

### Business Analytics
- Applying statistical simulation to business decision-making
- Estimating customer preferences through probabilistic modeling
- Visualizing results in tabular format

## Technologies Used
- R
- R Markdown
- knitr (for table formatting)

## Files
- `bmw_dealership_simulation.Rmd` - R Markdown source code with simulation
- `bmw_dealership_simulation.pdf` - Knitted PDF output showing results

## Key Concepts
- Monte Carlo methods for business analytics
- Random sampling with `sample()` function
- For loops in R for iterative processes
- Frequency analysis and data aggregation
- Professional table formatting with knitr

## Skills Demonstrated
- Applying simulation to real-world problems
