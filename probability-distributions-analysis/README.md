# Probability Distributions Analysis
*R Coding Assignment 4 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This comprehensive assignment explores six different probability distributions applied to real-world scenarios in traffic safety, sports analytics, quality control, sales forecasting, and political polling. Students demonstrate proficiency in selecting and applying appropriate probability models using R.

## Problem Scenarios

### 1. Traffic Safety Analysis (Poisson & Exponential)
Models accident occurrences at an intersection using Poisson distribution for counts and Exponential distribution for time between events. Demonstrates scaling λ for different time periods.

### 2. Sports Analytics (Negative Binomial)
Analyzes Barry Bonds' Home Run Derby performance using negative binomial distribution to model successes before a fixed number of failures.

### 3. Quarterback Performance (Geometric)
Applies geometric distribution to model the number of incomplete passes before the first completion, demonstrating first-success probability modeling.

### 4. Sales Forecasting (Negative Binomial)
Models telemarketing success using negative binomial distribution to predict the number of calls needed to achieve a sales quota.

### 5. Quality Control (Hypergeometric)
Implements acceptance sampling for microprocessor batches using hypergeometric distribution for sampling without replacement, demonstrating Type I error analysis.

### 6. Election Polling (Multinomial)
Analyzes voter preference distribution using multinomial distribution for multiple categorical outcomes.

## Topics Covered

### Discrete Probability Distributions
- **Poisson Distribution**: Rare events with constant average rate
- **Negative Binomial**: Trials until r successes
- **Geometric Distribution**: Trials until first success
- **Hypergeometric**: Sampling without replacement
- **Multinomial**: Multiple categorical outcomes

### Continuous Probability Distributions
- **Exponential Distribution**: Time between Poisson events

### Statistical Concepts
- Cumulative vs. exact probabilities
- Complement rule for "at least" calculations
- Parameter scaling for different time periods
- Type I and Type II errors in quality control
- Expected vs. observed distributions
