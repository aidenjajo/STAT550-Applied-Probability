# R Simulation Fundamentals
*Lab 1 from STAT550 - Applied Probability*

## Overview
This lab introduces foundational R programming concepts essential for statistical computing and simulation studies. Students learn to simulate random events, use for-loops for repeated experiments, create visualizations, and work with Boolean logic - all fundamental skills for applied probability work.

## Topics Covered

### Random Sampling & Simulation
- Using `sample()` function for random number generation
- Understanding the `replace = TRUE` parameter
- Simulating die rolls and computing averages
- Building intuition for expected values

### For-Loops & Iteration
- Implementing for-loops for repeated experiments
- Storing simulation results in vectors
- Running 1000+ simulation experiments
- Analyzing convergence toward expected values

### Data Visualization
- Creating histograms with `hist()`
- Adding density curves to plots
- Overlaying normal approximations
- Interpreting distribution shapes and characteristics

### Statistical Analysis
- Computing means and standard deviations
- Understanding the Central Limit Theorem through simulation
- Observing how sample size affects accuracy
- Interpreting variability in simulation results

### Boolean Logic
- Using Boolean expressions (`==`, `>`, etc.)
- Counting events with logical conditions
- Calculating empirical probabilities from simulations
- Comparing simulation results to theoretical probabilities

### Professional Documentation
- Creating tables with `xtable` and `pander`
- Using `replicate()` function
- R Markdown formatting and presentation
- Generating reproducible statistical reports

## Technologies Used
